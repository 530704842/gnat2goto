# GNAT2GOTO
An [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) frontend for
[CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc). Named thus because it is implemented
as a backend for the [GNAT Ada Compiler](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/)
(see also: [AdaCore](https://www.adacore.com/)), that produces a GOTO program
(the internal program representation of CBMC) in JSON format.

For instructions on building the project, see [gnat2goto/COMPILING.md](gnat2goto/COMPILING.md)
